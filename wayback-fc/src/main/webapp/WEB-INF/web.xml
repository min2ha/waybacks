    	Wayback runs as a single Servlet Filter, which intercepts all incoming
    	requests.
    	
    	AccessPoints are defined in a Spring configuration file, and register
    	themselves to handle incoming requests with this Filter. If no 
    	AccessPoint matches an incoming request, the filter does nothing, 
    	falling back to normal request processing, but this is an exceptional
    	case: To enable "virtual" AccessPoints to share the common
    	static content (and especially .jsp files) directly under the webapp
    	directory, AccessPoints will generally strip leading path information,
    	and forward() the requests internally to the top level of the webapp
    	directory. To allow .jsp files to customize output based on the 
    	particular AccessPoint which matched the request, references to the 
    	AccessPoint, and other data structures are often stored in the 
    	HttpServletRequest objects before forwarding these requests. In this 
    	case, the AccessPoint will inform the common request Filter that 
    	content has been returned, so "normal" request processing is skipped.
    	
    	In general, only 2 configurations are needed, which are both 
    	webapp-relative paths to configuration.
    	
    	Specifically, this is a logging configuration .properties file, for
    	java.util.logging (logging-config-path) and a Spring XML configuration
    	file describing the set of AccessPoints objects (and their internal 
    	objects) being served by this webapp (config-path).
